<h1>About Me</h1>


<p>Hello! My name is Audra, and I am a digital artist and a fashion lover.

     My art syle aligns with semi-realism but it also looks animated as well. 

    I am currently in my 3rd semester of college and I am working towards my associates degree in art & design.
    
    I have always been interested in fashion and art, so I plan to combine the two 
     
    and pursue a career in graphic design, with the intent of aligning it with fashion. 
    
    In my free time, I enjoy creating digital art, exploring new fashion trends,and social activities with friends. 
    
    I am excited to continue learning and growing as a web designer and artist!</p>
